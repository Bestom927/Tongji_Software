  Throughout the project, we constantly communication with the general public and biological researchers, providing guidance for us to improve our content and discover the social significance of our project. The advancement of our project is inseparable from human practices, and in the interaction, we also try to make more people understand what synthetic biology is and the concept of iGEM. We believe that what we are doing is not only simple software but also something beneficial to the future of human. Thank you very much to all the people who have helped us. Our human practice can be described in three main areas: Inspiration & Problems, Design & Improvement, and Meaning & Applications.

  Due to the current rapid development of macroeconomics, many potential Acr proteins are waiting to be mined, thus expanding the ranks of the Acr protein family, and providing more available tools for synthetic biology. Therefore, to enhance the peopleâ€™s knowledge about Acr proteins and encourage their participation in Acr protein discovery, which contribute to the mining of the value of Acr protein applications in synthetic biology, we hope to design an Acr mining software AcrGPS that is easily usable, high-throughput-compatible and available to users with inferior professional background. We try to keep improving our design by constantly communicating with our teachers and students to make it meet people's needs more.

  In September 2022 our team went to The Obstetrics & Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University to talk to the doctors and introduce the iGEM competition and our project to them. They were excited when we talked about the Acr protein to improve the safety of gene editing. Probably, when we use gene editing in our usual biological experiments, the gene editing technology has been more mature because of the standardized and process-oriented operation to avoid the off-target effect of gene editing. However, in the medical field, it is very crucial to address off-target effects, and the safety of gene editing is at the first rank in research fields such as gene therapy. They believe that the Acr protein that we have mined is very useful and look forward to the day when this protein can bring great benefits to human beings.

When we preparing for the communication with Erlian Elementary School, we shared with Mr. Xia, the teacher of the elementary school's science and technology class, and introduced synthetic biology and the iGEM competition to him. We also asked him if a project like ours could do anything for younger children like elementary school students. He said, "Actually, elementary school students are more knowledgeable than we think, probably because of the advanced internet. There is a lot of knowledge that we think children won't know, but that just comes from our subjective assumption." This also inspired us to go into elementary schools to conduct a gene editing science curriculum (see <a href="https://2022.igem.wiki/tongji-software/communication" >Communication.</a>) to bring more attention to gene editing in our lives. The successful completion of our course was supported and endorsed by him, and he also helped us with many formalities.

In our exchange with the DUT_China team, we also discussed the current state of research on the off-target effects of gene editing and whether Acr proteins have advantages in avoiding off-target effects. (See <a href="https://2022.igem.wiki/tongji-software/collaborations" >Collaborations</a>) By sharing the information we collected and the content of the project, we concluded that Acr protein has an irreplaceable advantage to deal with off-target effects and it is broad spectrum and easy usability make it a convenient tool.
</p>
<br/>
<p style={{width:"85vw",marginLeft:"8vw",fontWeight:"bold"}}>
All in all, we continued to improve our project and clarify the meaning of our project during the process of integrated human practice. The future development and application of Acr are more extensive and powerful than we imagined and make us more confident and motivated to keep improving what we are doing, and even hope to continuously devote to the research in this field and refine our software after we finished this project. Some of our perceptions change as we continue to interact with people, and the exclamation, "So that's what it is!" often occurred in our communication process. If we don't communicate with the world, we won't be constantly updating our ideas, keeping up with the current, and bringing our projects closer to humanity itself. These are significances we learned from human practice process.
