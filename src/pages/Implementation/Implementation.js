We propose some speculations for future users based on the developed software, and further make it clear from the feedback from existing users what we should do next and how security risks will arise to consider.

For our project, we provide tools to obtain from genome FASTA / from NCBI number whether the analysis has a corresponding ACR protein or not.

Challenges and how to implement our project in reality</h2>

In fact, it is a pleasure to see that our project may be helpful in the work of other research teams. We can also take some inspiration for software improvements from feedback from other teams.

Having interacted with Sun Yat sen University team when they suggested that perhaps ACR protein counterparts could be identified with outputs as well as inhibitory activity strengths, we planned to identify the acquired ACR protein counterparts by starting with features such as higher order structure of the protein, but this made it difficult to generate sufficiently accurate determinations in a short time due to the diversity of structures as well as mechanisms of action. </p>

      <p style={{width:"75vw",marginLeft:"8vw"}}>


      In addition we plan to explore whether it might be possible to migrate approaches to ACR proteins that target other CAS proteins, based on existing studies that have engineered cas9 targeted ACR proteins for optogenetics, among others.

<p style={{width:"75vw",marginLeft:"8vw"}}>
The proteins identified by this tool belong to a class of genetically encoded biological elements of biological origin that require subsequent engineering or editing efforts to avoid the outflow of the encoded gene from the laboratory causing biological
Material safety events (e.g. acquisition of proteins by certain phages, thus better infection of host bacteria)</p>
